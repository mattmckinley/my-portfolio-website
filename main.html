        <h2 style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 20px;">Hi I'm Matt. I like to draw, bake and create.</h2>
        <p>---</p>
        <p style="padding-right: 20px;">Matt is an illustrator living and working in Manchester, England. His work is instantly recognizable for its distinctive mixture of detailed realism and monochrome palette. This style is an amalgamation of a lifetime passion for drawing, an eye for detail and being colour blind. Where others see colour, Matt sees shades and textures, the fine stitching on a shoe, the faded stickers on a street lamppost.
        </p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p style="padding-right: 20px;">He finds inspiration from architecture, men’s fashion and pop culture, as well as childhood nostalgia of cartoons and an interest in classic illustration and art. Matt is a proud northerner, having grown up in the North West, attending the University of Cumbria for his foundation in Fine Art, before moving to Manchester to study Design and Art Direction at Manchester School of Art. Since graduating, Matt worked as a freelance graphic designer before deciding to focus solely on his unique style of illustration.
        </p>
        <p>---</p>
        <p style="padding-right: 20px;">Matt’s now embarking on a journey into code and hoping to start a career in the industry. He feels like he has a great mix of traditional art and design styles that will be able to mix with the ever developing digital world.
